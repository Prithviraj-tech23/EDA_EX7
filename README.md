# 📊 Over-Plotting Reduction in Social Media Analytics (R)

## 📌 Student Information

* **Name:** P S S PRITHIVI RAJ
* **Roll No:** 23BAD088

## 📖 Project Description

This project demonstrates techniques to **reduce over-plotting in large-scale data visualization** using **R**.
The dataset represents **social media interactions**, specifically analyzing the relationship between **Likes** and **Comments**.

Over-plotting is a common issue when visualizing large datasets, where multiple data points overlap and obscure meaningful patterns. This project applies effective visualization techniques to improve clarity and analytical accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To apply visualization techniques that reduce **visual clutter** and improve **interpretability** in large datasets.

---



## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** R
* **Environment:** R / RStudio
* **Visualization:** Base R plotting functions

---

## ⚙️ Techniques Implemented

### 1️⃣ Alpha Blending

* Uses transparency to reveal point density.
* Helps identify clusters in heavily overlapped data.

### 2️⃣ Jittering

* Adds small random noise to data points.
* Prevents exact overlaps for discrete values.

### 3️⃣ Aggregation & Binning

* Groups values into bins using `cut()`.
* Displays frequency using a heatmap.
* Best suited for very large datasets.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Place the dataset in the specified directory
3. Open the script file
4. Run the script line-by-line or entirely

Each visualization opens in a **new graphics window**.

---

## 📈 Output Visualizations

* Alpha blended scatter plot (Likes vs Comments)
* Jittered scatter plot
* Aggregated heatmap using binned data

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Understand causes and risks of over-plotting
* Apply visual clarity techniques in big data
* Improve scalability for AI-driven analytics
* Interpret dense datasets effectively

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

Ignoring over-plotting can lead to **misleading conclusions** and **hidden patterns**.
The applied techniques significantly enhance readability, accuracy, and analytical value of social media engagement data.
